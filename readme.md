## ToDoMVC

This app is written to learn how to use API's to communicate with an external server.

Here we will build an app that communcates with github API and then
displays open issues in the todo list.
Additionally you will be able to close issues.

### Notes:
This assignment is proving to be a little more complicated than I initially thought.
I can recieve information from github api just fine, but for some reason I can't
send data back... I'll continue looking into this, but here's my work for now.
